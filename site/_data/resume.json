    "summary": "I've been programming and tinkering with computers since I first got my hands on them back in the 90s. I love a challenge and my favorite thing way to learn is being confronted with a problem I don't yet know how to solve—which is why when it comes to programming I'm entirely self-taught. I'm comfortable being responsible for an entire project or feature—most of my career has seen me operating, effectively, as a team of one—but I also love working with others as part of a team, both to learn and to mentor.",
