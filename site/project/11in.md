[11ty](https://www.11ty.dev) is my current favorite static site generator:
It's as simple or as involved as you want it to be, and it exposes a lot of great tools to build things however you like.
Building sites with 11ty can be *fast* but I found myself rebuilding a lot of things and having to struggle setting up an asset build process every time I made a new site.
11in is my attempt at putting together a framework (and a set of extensions) to help reduce that boilerplate and provide a bunch of nice stuff "out of the box."

By itself, 11in mainly does two things:

- Provide a robust, fast, modern CSS/JS build process
- Provide a framework for easily extending 11ty (without ending up with a huge `eleventy.config.js`)

Fun fact: This site is running on 11in.
